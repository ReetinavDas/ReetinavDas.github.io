Hi there! My name is Reetinav Das, and I'm a fourth year student at UCLA majoring in Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing and minoring in Data Science Engineering! (That's a mouthful.) My primary interests are in computer vision and machine learning, and I especially love when I get the chance to combine the both of them.
